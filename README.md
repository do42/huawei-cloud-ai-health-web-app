Our project “AI-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application” came first in the Huawei Türkiye R&D Coding Marathon 2023. 
Before running you must change your iam user credentials a function in functions.py (flask_app/app/functions.py)  called get_xauth() (https://github.com/do42/huawei-cloud-ai-health-web-app/blob/8dd415bb9c9c8d12e356878c20387afe3439fd25/flask_app/app/functions.py#L59).
You can run this code locally on a Docker container using the Docker file. It is running on 5000 port, "http://localhost:5000".
